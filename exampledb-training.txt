     EXAMPLE 5:
     Question: "Which product category has the highest average price?"
     SQL: SELECT T2.category_name FROM products T1 JOIN categories T2 ON 
   T1.category_id = T2.category_id GROUP BY T1.category_id ORDER BY AVG(T1.price) DESC
    LIMIT 1;
     
     EXAMPLE 6:
     Question: "How many orders were placed in 2023?"

     EXAMPLE 9:
     Question: "List the top 3 most ordered products by quantity"
     SQL: SELECT T2.product_name FROM order_items T1 JOIN products T2 ON T1.product_id
    = T2.product_id GROUP BY T1.product_id ORDER BY SUM(T1.quantity) DESC LIMIT 3;
     
     EXAMPLE 10:
     Question: "Which customer spent the most money total?"
     SQL: SELECT customer_id FROM orders GROUP BY customer_id ORDER BY 
   SUM(total_amount) DESC LIMIT 1;
     
     KEY PATTERNS FROM EXAMPLES:
     - Customer analysis: Use customers table with city, state columns
     - Product queries: Use products table with price, category_id columns
     - Order analysis: Use orders table with status, total_amount, order_date columns
     - Revenue calculations: SUM(total_amount) for financial totals
     - Time filtering: Use LIKE '2023%' for year-based date filtering
     - Most/highest questions: ORDER BY column DESC LIMIT 1
     - Counting patterns: COUNT(*) with GROUP BY for frequency analysis
     - Product-order relationships: JOIN order_items with products for detailed 
   analysis
     - Status filtering: WHERE status = 'completed'/'pending'/'shipped'
