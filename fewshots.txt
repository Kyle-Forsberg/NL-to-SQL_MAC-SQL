- Award queries: `player_award` table with award_id and year columns
- "Most frequent" questions: GROUP BY column ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC LIMIT 1
- "Highest/top" questions: ORDER BY column DESC LIMIT 1 (or LIMIT N for top N)
- Statistical queries: Use SUM(), AVG(), COUNT(), MAX(), MIN()
- Text filtering: Use LIKE '%text%' for partial matches
